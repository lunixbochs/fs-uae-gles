FS-UAE 1.2.1 README

FS-UAE is a multi-platform Amiga emulator for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X
based on WinUAE/E-UAE/PUAE, with a focus on emulating floppy-disk and CD-ROM
based games.

FS-UAE is fully controllable with a gamepad, with an on-screen GUI, which
means that you can easily swap floppies and load save states with your
gamepad. Because of this, FS-UAE is well suited to be started from an
emulator frontend running on a HTPC, but will work equally great on your
personal computer.

The emulator uses the cycle-exact emulation code from WinUAE and requires a
moderately fast computer with accelerated graphics (OpenGL) to work.

The official home page of FS-UAE is:

Thank you for your interest in FS-UAE :)


IMPORTANT INFORMATION
=====================
FS-UAE does not include a configuration UI, so you must create a configuration
file before the emulator will be usable. This is fairly easy, please
read on for more information.

Please report any errors found in the documentation to fs-uae@fengestad.no.


CONFIGURATION FILE
==================
You will also need to create a configuration file for FS-UAE.  The important
things you need to configure is what floppy disks to use, and where the
Kickstart ROMs are stored. Documentation (and examples) is available here:
http://fengestad.no/wp/fs-uae/documentation

You have several options for where to store the configuration file:

1. In the same directory as the FS-UAE executable, as Config.fs-uae. FS-UAE
will always try to load this file first.

2. As a per-user configuration file:
(My) Documents/FS-UAE/Configurations/Default.fs-uae

3. You can also store the file anywhere you want, and invoke FS-UAE with
the config file as a parameter (fs-uae /path/to/config-file.fs-uae)

4. In graphical shells (Windows Explorer, Mac OS Finder), you can also
select a configuration file, and then choose to open it in FS-UAE (you
may need to browse to find the program), or you may also drag and drop
a configuration file in top of the FS-UAE application/executable.

(you can see in the log file exactly what path FS-UAE tries to load the
default configuration from on your system)


KICKSTART
=========
You will need Kickstart ROMs for the Amigas you want to emulate. One source
for this is your real Amiga, but you can also purchase the Kickstart ROMs
in file format from Cloanto - they are bundled in their Amiga Forever-product.


JOYSTICKS
=========
If you have a recognized joystick connected, FS-UAE will automatically try
to use this as the primary Amiga joystick. Otherwise, keyboard joystick
emulation will be enabled, where the cursor keys and the right control (right
alt on Mac) on your keyboard controls the joystick.

FS-UAE does not (currently) support two keyboard emulated joysticks. If you
want to use two Amiga joysticks, you need to have at least one real joystick
or gamepad.

You can specify which joystick to use for each Amiga joystick port. Please
see example.conf for more information. Information about supported controllers
are here:
http://fengestad.no/wp/fs-uae/controllers

If your joystick is not recognized by FS-UAE (you can see this in the log
file), you can create a configuration file for it. See
http://fengestad.no/wp/fs-uae/custom-controller-configuration

If you create a configuration file, I would appreciate it if you would
send a copy to fs-uae@fengestad.no with the producer and model name of
the joystick/gamepad (for inclusing in future versions of FS-UAE). 


EMULATOR MENU
=============
While running the emulator, you press F12 to enter and exit the emulator menu.
From here, you can load and save states, and swap floppy disks. On Mac OS X,
you can use Cmd + F12 instead (Possibly even FN + Cmd + F12).

With gamepads, you enter the menu either by using the dedicated "menu" button,
if the gamepad has one, or you press and hold "start" and "selected" at the
same time (or equivalent buttons).

You use the same key/button to dismiss the menu.

In the menu, you use the following keys for navigation:
Cursor keys
Enter (choose item, enter sub-menu)
Back-space (leave sub-menu)

On the game pad, you can use either the hat or the primary analog stick
for navigation. You choose items and enter sub-menus with the "primary"
button on the game pad. This is generally the "south" button on the right
side of the controller. The back button is the "east" button (Just like
you would navigate on the Xbox).


SCREENSHOTS
===========
Press the "Print Scrn" key on the keyboard to save a screenshot of the
running game to the desktop.


KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
==================
F12 - Toggle menu (On Mac: Cmd + F12 or FN + Cmd + F12)
F11 - Ungrab/grab mouse pointer (On Mac: Cmd + F11 or FN + Cmd + F11)

CTRL + F10 - Toggle audio/video performance overlay
CTRL + F11 - Toggle debug crop rectangle for autoscale algorithm


PROGRAM ARGUMENTS
=================
<path>               Use a custom configuration file
--video-sync=auto    Automatically enable approriate sync mode
--video-sync=off     Do not enable vsync
--video-sync=vblank  Will sync rendering to vblank interval (avoid tearing)
--video-sync=full    Sync emulation to vblank interval
--fullscreen         Start in fullscreen mode instead of windowed mode
--stdout             Also log to stdout (not on Windows)

You can also override any configuration option with --key=value
(e.g --floppy-drive-0=/path/to/adf)


LOG FILE AND REPORTING PROBLEMS
===============================
A log file is stored as (My) Documents/FS-UAE/Logs/FS-UAE.log

When reporting a problem, you should include this log file with you error
report.


FLOPPY DISKS
============
New data is always saved to overlay ADF files (.sdf). As an example, if you
have floppy.adf insert into df0 and the Amiga writes to df0, the data is
written to floppy.sdf instead of modifying floppy.adf itself. You need both
floppy.adf and floppy.sdf to represent the entire modified disk. The save
files are created on demand (when data is written to a drive).

The floppy file overlays are by default save in the directory
(My) Documents/FS-UAE/Floppy Overlays

The GUI does not allow you to browse for files on the file system. Disks
can be inserted at startup time (specified in the configuration file), and
FS-UAE maintains a list of available floppy images to insert (also specified
in the configuration file). See example.conf for more information.


SUPPORTED AMIGA MODELS
======================
The following Amiga models are supported:
- Amiga 500
- Amiga 500+
- Amiga 600
- Amiga 1200
- Amiga 1200/020
- Amiga 4000
- Amiga CD32
- Commodore CDTV

The default configurations corresponds to the quickstarts in WinUAE for
these systems, on the most compatible setting (cycle-exact mode). 


DISPLAY REFRESH RATE AND RESOLUTION
===================================
For really smooth scrolling in games, your display MUST run at the same
refresh rate as the Amiga: 50Hz (PAL). Many monitors and TVs with 1920x1080
resolution supports this refresh rate. If FS-UAE detects that you display is
running at 50Hz, vsync will automatically be enabled for perfect scrolling.

FS-UAE will (not yet) on its own change your refresh rate to 50Hz -you
must do this yourself before starting FS-UAE.

If you run your display with another refresh rate, the emulator will still
work just fine, but scrolling will be somewhat jerky -it varies with games
whether this is very noticable or not.

Note: On Mac OS X, FS-UAE does not currently detect the refresh rate,
which means that full vsync will not be enabled. If you are running at
50Hz, you can force vsync with --video-sync=full

FS-UAE will use whatever full-screen resolution you desktop is using, and
will assume that you have square pixels. The Amiga image will be scaled
to fit the display, and you can choose whether to stretch to fill the entire
screen, or scale up while maintaining the original aspect ratio.


SUPPORTED HOST OPERATING SYSTEM
===============================
- Linux (Other Unices will probably also work just fine)
- Windows
- Mac OS X 10.6 or newer


DEBUGGING SUPPORT
=================
FS-UAE does not include a debugger for debugging Amiga programs. For
debugging FS-UAE itself, a native debugger can be used if you compile FS-UAE
yourself. Other debug information can be retrieved from the log file.

There is debug overlay to debug video, audio and vsync issues. You can toggle
the display of this with CTRL+F10.

FS-UAE automatically crops the Amiga video output. Sometimes this does not
work perfectly. You can override this behaviour in the configuration file.
Also, you can press CTRL+F11 when running to visually see the entire amiga
output with the crop rectangle.


KNOWN ISSUES / TODO
===================
CD32 gamepad (emulated by keyboard)

Amiga mouse must currently be emulated with a native mouse device. A nice
feature would be to be able to emulate the mouse with gamepads - analogue
controls for instance.

An on-screen keyboard, controllable with a game pad / joystick would also
be nice, and is planned for a future version.

Floppy list UI does not support scrolling, so if you have many floppy images
in the floppy list, some may be obscured.
