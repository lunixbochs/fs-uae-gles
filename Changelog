Version 1.2.0

* Fixed bug causing blank screenshots to be saved.

Version 1.2.0rc2

  used directly. 
* Shift+F11 now toggles padding the viewport with 10 pixels.
* Shift+F12 now releases input focus (in addition to alt+tab and middle-click).
* F12 cannot be combined with (ctrl, shift, alt) now to open the menu,
  modifier keys are reserved for future shortcuts (Cmd+F12 can still be
  used on Mac since Mac OS "swallows" F12 if used alone).
* New option "end_config" can be used to prevent loading of additional
  configuration files (Host.fs-uae...).
* Do not warn about "no configuration file loaded" if end_config was
  specified via program arguments.

  debugging a problem.

* Added .desktop application launcher file for Linux.
* Added FS-UAE icon (in different sizes) to the icons/hicolor folders.
* Set window icon via _NET_WM_ICON on Linux.
* Fixed bug when scanline (dark/light) intensity was set to 0.

* Changed the way shared data files are looked up -compatible with the
  XDG standard now.
* Don't trust refresh rate from xrandr with only one mode in mode list.

Version 1.1.9

* Merged updated code from filesys.cpp isofs.cpp and isofs_api.h, fixes
  crash when inserting CD image.
* Fix screenshot saving when buffers are BGRA.
* new option to choose between video sync methods (video_sync_method).
* Use older video sync method as default
* New default port for net play: 25100 (the port range from 25100
  to 25500 is by default used for the new net play service).
* New options fullscreen_width, fullscreen_height (especially useful
  to force output to one display only on a Linux/nVIDIA/twinview setup).

Version 1.1.8

* Always load default host-specific configuration values from Host.fs-uae,
  if it exists (useful for fullscreen settings, etc).
* Support replacement prefix $config in paths - will be replaced by
  the directory containing the current configuration file.
* Boolean options ("1" or "0") can now be simplified when specifying as
  program arguments as --arg (same as --arg=1) or --no-arg (same as --arg=0).
  For instance you can just use --fullscreen or --no-fullscreen.

Version 1.1.7

* Try creating a OpenAL context at 48000 Hz first.
* Use GL_ARB_sync extension for display synchronization where available.

Version 1.1.6

* Use GL_NV_fence extension for display synchronization where available.

* Use smaller texture for text rendering and caching (for now).

Version 1.1.5

* F11 key toggles between autoscale mode and a few fixed viewports.
* Some minor rendering updates.
* Ignore viewport setting in RTG mode.
* Swap red/blue color channel when saving screenshots in BGRA mode.
* Center amiga display, not crop, when keep_aspect is 1.
* Stretch overscan border to fill screen if keep_aspect is 1.
* Always set cpu_idle option.

Version 1.1.4

* Add fullscreen size and window size as RTG screen modes.
* Dynamically increase video buffer sizes if necessary.
* Options added to change video buffer format and internal texture format.
* Use GL_BGRA as the default video buffer format.
* Use GL_RGB as the default internal texture format for Amiga video frames.
* Write information about OpenGL renderer to log file.
* Hack to correct the output of the autoscale algorithm in some specific
  situations (some Workbench screens, etc), hack will be updated/removed
  as necessary.

Version 1.1.3

* Fixed crash when accessing the input options menu.
* Fix rendering of fonts in dialogs.

Version 1.1.2

* You can also configure parallel port joysticks from the menu now. 
* Show CD-CDROM drive selector in GUI (for all Amiga models) if CD-ROM drive
  is enabled.
* Cloanto ROMs are now properly scanned on startup. No need to specify
  kickstart_file unless you want to use a non-standard kickstart.
* Choice between soft and hard reset when choosing "Amiga Reset"; also gives
  a bit more protection against accidental reset.

  was mounted read-only.
* Re-enabled bsdsocket.library for Linux and Mac.
* Use path resolving function for *_dir path options too.
* Match more disk names with built-in regexp (for name shortening).
* Write read configuration key/values to log file (for debugging, no need to
  send config + log file any longer; just the log file will do).
* Re-organized the FS-UAE on-screen main menu.
* Menu font re-drawn a bit smaller and thinner.
* Use only older OpenGL features, should work fine on OpenGL 1.4/1.5
  implementations now (possibly also OpenGL 1.1).
* Use a texture atlas for GUI elements to reduce the amount of state changes.
* BEAMCON0 hack for P96 restricted to only setting PAL bit.
* Support new naming scheme for controller configuration files (used for
  config files created by new new external controller configuration tool).
* Added controller configurations: usb_2_axis_8_button_gamepad.ini,
  (thrustmaster) t_mini_wireless.ini
* Showing FS-UAE application icon in window menu and application switcher
  on Windows.
* Disable most Windows hot keys (the "Windows" key, etc) when running FS-UAE.
* Disable sticky keys shortcut (and toggle keys etc) on Windows so these
  don't interfere with game play.

Version 1.1.1

* CDFS fix for lowercase file names.
* OpenGL performance improvements (avoid unnecessary state changes).
* Support fullscreen/window mode switcing with alt+return.
* On Mac/Linux you can press alt+tab to release input focus / mouse grab.
* On Windows, alt+tabbing also releases mouse grab
* On Mac/Linux, alt+tab also temporarily switches to window mode if
  in fullscreen, hold down alt and press alt once more to start cycling
  through windows as normal (alt+tab already worked on MS Windows).
* Use "real" fullscreen mode on Linux/Mac now since fullscreen/window
  switching is implemented.
* On Mac you can use cmd+tab and cmd+return instead of alt+tab/alt+return.

  also be used in net play mode.

  files - RDB format is automatically recognized).
* Grabbing input on startup is optional (see example.conf).
* Keys are now "positionally" mapped (as much as possible) from host keyboard
  to amiga keys (some exceptions because of physically different layout:
  home = lparen, page up = rparen, delete = del, end = help,
  insert is mapped to the amiga key to the left of backspace, and page down
  to right amiga key in case the host keyboard has no right windows/apple/menu

 * Support for hard drive images (hdf)
 * Support for mounting virtual folders as hard drives (experimental)
