REQUIREMENTS
============
- GCC compiler suite (with C/C++ support) (mingw on Windows)
- GNU make

You need the following libraries (with development files)
- SDL
- libpng
- zlib
- glib (2.24 or newer)
- OpenAL
- OpenGL


COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================================
To compile the program, just enter the command

  make

The resulting program is placed in the "out" directory. If you want to
install on a Unix-like OS, run:

  make install prefix=/usr/local

(or you can omit prefix to install to the default location /usr)


MAC OS X
========
You should instead cd into the folder macosx and run make there. This will
create FS-UAE.app!

Macports is a great way to get all the dependencies.


WINDOWS
======
You need to have mingw and msys installed and must run "make" from the
mingw/msys shell (msys.bat). The required libraries must be present on the
normal development path. 

If you are building the dependencies from source, you can configure them
with --prefix=/mingw

The easiest way to get most of the dependencies is to download compiled
versions from http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php. (glib, zlib, libpng and
gettext-runtime). You will ned both "Run-Time" and "Dev" packages.

SDL library and development files can be downloaded here:
http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
You will need the runtime libraries, and development libraries (the one
labeled Mingw32)

When unpacking the dependencies, unpack them to C:\MinGW (or wherever you
installed MinGW)


DEBIAN
======
This command will install the needed dependencies for building FS-UAE:

  apt-get install build-essential libsdl1.2-dev libopenal-dev libglib2.0-dev


FEDORA
======
This command will install the needed dependencies for building FS-UAE:

  yum install gcc gcc-c++ make openal-devel SDL-devel mesa-libGL-devel \
          mesa-libGLU-devel glib2-devel libpng-devel

Then build FS-UAE by running "make".

If you want to create an RPM, please configure your system according to
http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_create_an_RPM_package
You should then be able to build an RPM with

  rpmbuild -ba fs-uae.spec
